    static let mock = "One of my heroes around town, a man who gave us our first dishwasher, was a Marine in Vietnam. He took me around the local Marine Corps League and taught me the meaning of service: selflessness, sacrifice, doing the right thing when no one is looking and expecting nothing in return. So after Yale and then law school at Mizzou, I joined the Marine Corps to honor and serve the community that had done so much for me. Less than a year after I completed training, I deployed to Iraq on my first of three tours of duty in the War on Terror, before later being stationed at the Pentagon. During those 13 years of active duty I learned firsthand what service and sacrifice for your country really means, the same things I had heard about down at the Apache Flats Marine Corps League: Doing the right thing when you’re thousands of miles from home, believing in a mission that’s bigger than yourself, and never forgetting the community you signed up to serve."
